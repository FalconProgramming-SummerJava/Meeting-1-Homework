# Meeting-1-Homework
Do these by Monday, June 8th

1. Create a Car Class. Every car has a color, model, and top speed. Make a method in the Car class to print this information. In your program's Main class, instantiate (create) 2 cars with different properties, and use the aforementioned method on each object to print those properties you assigned each car.

2. BONUS: Make a race method - it should compare the top speeds of two cars, and return the winner.
